TODO: Build a site selection app using the ArcGIS Platform ;)
NOTE: You will be building an application which uses the GeoEnrichment service from the ArcGIS Platform
      - You can create an account and API Key here https://developers.arcgis.com/
      - Your API Key *must* be scoped to the following services:
        ~ Geocoding (not stored) 
        ~ Service Area
        ~ GeoEnrichment
      - Adding these services to your API key will require configuring billing on your account
